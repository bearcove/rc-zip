//! State machines built atop parsers, ready to bring your own I/O with.
//!
//! Parsers are just part of the puzzle when it comes to zip files: finding the
//! central directory is non-trivial and involves seeking around the input:
//! [ArchiveFsm] provides a state machine to handle this.
//!
//! Similarly, reading an entry involves reading the local header, then the
//! data (while calculating the CRC32), then the data descriptor, and then
//! checking whether the uncompressed size and CRC32 match the values in the
//! central directory.
