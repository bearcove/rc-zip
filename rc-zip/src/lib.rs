#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! rc-zip is a [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html) library for reading zip files.
//!
//! It's made up of a bunch of types representing the various parts of a zip
//! file, winnow parsers that can turn byte buffers into those types, and
//! state machines that can use those parsers to read zip files from a stream.
//!
//! This crate is low-level, you may be interested in either of those higher
//! level wrappers:
//!
//!   * [rc-zip-sync](https://crates.io/crates/rc-zip-sync) for using std I/O traits
//!   * [rc-zip-tokio](https://crates.io/crates/rc-zip-tokio) for using tokio I/O traits
